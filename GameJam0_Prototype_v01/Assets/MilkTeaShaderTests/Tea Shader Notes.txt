1. Add the ripple particle prefab to a platform as a child. 
2.Under the particle system Renderer tab, change the material between SquareRippleMat and CircleRippleMat for Cubes and Spheres
3.Change the particles to a new layer called RippleLayer
4. Add a camera in the center of the plane.
5.Raise it up high.
6.Rotate it facing down 90 on the X axis.
7.Set the Background Type of the camera to color and set it to pure black.
8.Set the Culling Mask of the camera to only the Ripple Layer.
9.Create a new RenderTexture and assign it to the camera. The texture should be 1024 x 1024, MipMaps Enabled.
10.Add the script Set Interactive Shader Effects to the camera.
11.Add the RenderTexture to the RT slot.
12.Add a GameObject transform to the target to have the camera follow around an object. Or simply put the Camera transform in the target slot.


NOTE: You'll probably only want to have the ripples play when the character lands on the platform or else the entire tea is going to be covered with white foam.
If so, set the Particle Prefab Loop checkbox to off

//When player lands, play ripple burst once
rippleParticle.Emit();

Also, the Waves parameters of the shader should typically only be used on high poly planes.
